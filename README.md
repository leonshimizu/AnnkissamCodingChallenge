# AnnkissamCodingChallenge

Hi Annkissam/HHAeXchange team, 

Thank you for the opportunity to complete your coding challenge. In this repository, there are 2 files, one (finder.rb) with the logic I wrote to solve the problem, and the other (finder_test.rb) with the code to run some tests to make sure that the logic is working as intended. 

To run the tests, in the terminal, run 'ruby finder_test.rb'. 

Lastly, please do not hesitate to reach out if you need anything else from me. (email: Lmshimizu@gmail.com, phone: 702-742-1168)
